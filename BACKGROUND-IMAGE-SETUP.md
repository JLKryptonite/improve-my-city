# Background Image Setup

## Adding the Architectural Background

To complete the blurred architectural background design:

1. **Save the architectural building image** (the one you shared showing the historic building with wet streets) to the `public` folder
2. **Rename it to:** `building-background.jpg`
3. **Alternative image formats:** You can also use `.png` or `.webp` if preferred

## Current Background Features

The CSS is now configured with:
- **Blurred background effect** (3px blur on the overlay)
- **Glass morphism effects** on all UI elements (navigation, cards, search bar)
- **Enhanced text shadows** for better readability
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

## Image Requirements

- **Minimum resolution:** 1920x1080 (full HD) for best quality
- **Format:** JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Content:** Should work well with text overlays (not too busy)
- **Aspect ratio:** Landscape orientation preferred

## Fallback

If the image fails to load, the page will fall back to a gradient background while maintaining all the glass effects and styling.
