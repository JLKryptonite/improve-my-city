# 🎉 Complaints Database Setup - Complete!

## Summary

Your **Improve My City** application now has a fully configured MongoDB database for storing and managing citizen complaints according to the complete complaint structure.

---

## ✅ What Was Set Up

### 1. Database Configuration
- **Database**: `improve-my-city`
- **Collection**: `complaints`
- **Connection**: `mongodb://localhost:27017/improve-my-city`
- **Status**: ✅ Active and tested

### 2. Complete Complaint Schema

Each complaint stored includes:

#### Core Information
- ✅ Category (Pothole, Streetlight, Garbage, etc.)
- ✅ Description
- ✅ Geographic Location (GeoJSON with coordinates)
- ✅ State, City, Ward information
- ✅ Current Status (pending/in_progress/stalled/revived/resolved)

#### Timestamps & Tracking
- ✅ Created timestamp
- ✅ Last activity timestamp
- ✅ First progress timestamp
- ✅ Stalled since timestamp
- ✅ Revived since timestamp
- ✅ Progress deadline (60 days default)

#### Media & Evidence
- ✅ Photos before (initial evidence)
- ✅ Photos during progress (work updates)
- ✅ Photos after (completion proof)

#### Work Management
- ✅ Assignment details (department ID, contractor ID, due date)
- ✅ Hold periods array (with start, end, expected resume, reason)
- ✅ Accumulated hold time in seconds
- ✅ Related complaint IDs (for merged complaints)

#### Complete Timeline
- ✅ Full event history
- ✅ Event types (submitted, progress_started, resolved, stalled_auto, etc.)
- ✅ Actor tracking (public, official, system)
- ✅ Notes and reasons for each event
- ✅ Images attached to specific events

### 3. Performance Optimization

Five indexes created for fast queries:
- ✅ **_id_** - Primary key (default)
- ✅ **location_2dsphere** - Geospatial queries (find nearby complaints)
- ✅ **status_state_city_category** - Compound index for filtering
- ✅ **created_at** - Chronological sorting
- ✅ **stalled_revived** - Status date tracking

### 4. Management Tools

Four new scripts created:

| Script | Command | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **test-complaints.js** | `npm run test-complaints` | Check database health & view statistics |
| **seed-complaints.js** | `npm run seed-complaints` | Add sample complaints for testing |
| **view-complaints.js** | `npm run view-complaints` | View complaints in detail with filters |
| **clear-complaints.js** | `npm run clear-complaints` | Delete all complaints (with confirmation) |

### 5. Sample Data Loaded

**6 test complaints** across 3 cities:

| ID | Category | City | Status |
|----|----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Pothole | Mumbai | Pending |
| 2 | Streetlight | Mumbai | In Progress |
| 3 | Garbage | Mumbai | Resolved |
| 4 | Water Supply | Bangalore | Pending |
| 5 | Road Construction | Bangalore | Stalled |
| 6 | Drainage | Delhi | Revived |

### 6. Documentation Created

Four comprehensive guides:

1. **QUICK-START-DATABASE.md** - Quick reference for daily use
2. **COMPLAINTS-DATABASE-SETUP.md** - Complete setup documentation
3. **scripts/COMPLAINTS-DB-GUIDE.md** - Detailed database management guide
4. **scripts/README.md** - All available scripts reference

## 📊 Current Database Status

```
Database: improve-my-city
Collection: complaints
Total Documents: 6
Indexes: 5

Status Breakdown:
  - Pending: 2
  - In Progress: 1
  - Resolved: 1
  - Stalled: 1
  - Revived: 1

Cities:
  - Mumbai: 3 complaints
  - Bangalore: 2 complaints
  - Delhi: 1 complaint
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Test the Database
```bash
npm run test-complaints
```

### View All Complaints
```bash
npm run view-complaints
```

### Filter Complaints
```bash
npm run view-complaints status=pending
npm run view-complaints city=Mumbai
npm run view-complaints category=Pothole
```

### Add More Sample Data
```bash
npm run seed-complaints
```

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### User Flow
```
1. User visits /report
2. Fills complaint form + uploads photos
3. Submits to POST /api/complaints
4. System validates location & photos
5. Checks for nearby duplicates
6. Creates complaint in MongoDB
7. Returns complaint ID
```

### Authority Flow
```
1. Authority logs in at /authority/login
2. Views complaints at /authority
3. Takes action (start progress, resolve, hold)
4. System updates MongoDB document
5. Adds timeline event
6. Updates status and timestamps
7. Changes reflected immediately
```

### Automatic Tracking
```
- System checks complaints daily
- If no progress for 60 days → Status: stalled
- When progress resumes → Status: revived
- Hold periods don't count toward stall time
- Timeline auto-logs all system actions
```
