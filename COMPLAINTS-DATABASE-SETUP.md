# Complaints Database Setup - Complete! âœ…

The complaints database has been successfully set up in MongoDB with the full complaint structure.

## What's Been Configured

### 1. MongoDB Collection: `complaints`

Your complaints are now being stored in:
- **Database**: `improve-my-city`
- **Collection**: `complaints`
- **Connection**: `mongodb://localhost:27017/improve-my-city`

### 2. Complete Complaint Schema

Each complaint document includes:

#### Core Fields
- âœ… Category (e.g., Pothole, Streetlight, Garbage)
- âœ… Description
- âœ… Location (GeoJSON with coordinates)
- âœ… State, City, Ward
- âœ… Status (pending, in_progress, stalled, revived, resolved)

#### Tracking Fields
- âœ… Created timestamp
- âœ… Last activity timestamp
- âœ… First progress timestamp
- âœ… Progress deadline (60 days default)
- âœ… Stalled/revived tracking

#### Media & Evidence
- âœ… Photos before (initial evidence)
- âœ… Photos during progress (work updates)
- âœ… Photos after (completion proof)

#### Work Management
- âœ… Assignment details (department, contractor, due date)
- âœ… Hold periods with reasons
- âœ… Accumulated hold time calculation
- âœ… Related complaint IDs for merges

#### Activity Timeline
- âœ… Complete event history
- âœ… Event types (submitted, progress_started, resolved, etc.)
- âœ… Actor tracking (public, official, system)
- âœ… Notes and images per event

### 3. Performance Indexes

Optimized for fast queries:
- âœ… Geospatial index (2dsphere) for location searches
- âœ… Compound index on status, state, city, category
- âœ… Created date index for chronological sorting
- âœ… Status date index for tracking

## Available Tools

### Management Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run test-complaints` | Check database status & statistics |
| `npm run seed-complaints` | Add 6 sample complaints for testing |
| `npm run view-complaints` | View all complaints in detail |
| `npm run view-complaints status=pending` | Filter by status |
| `npm run view-complaints city=Mumbai` | Filter by city |
| `npm run clear-complaints` | Delete all complaints |

### Current Sample Data

The database now contains **6 sample complaints**:

1. **Pothole** (Mumbai) - Status: PENDING
2. **Streetlight** (Mumbai) - Status: IN_PROGRESS
3. **Garbage** (Mumbai) - Status: RESOLVED
4. **Water Supply** (Bangalore) - Status: PENDING
5. **Road Construction** (Bangalore) - Status: STALLED
6. **Drainage** (Delhi) - Status: REVIVED

### Status Distribution
- ðŸŸ¡ Pending: 2 complaints
- ðŸ”µ In Progress: 1 complaint
- âœ… Resolved: 1 complaint
- ðŸ”´ Stalled: 1 complaint
- ðŸŸ  Revived: 1 complaint

## How It Works

### When Users Submit Complaints

1. **User submits via web interface** (`/report`)
   - Uploads photos
   - Selects location on map
   - Provides description

2. **API validates and processes** (`/api/complaints` POST)
   - Validates photo location and timestamp
   - Strips EXIF data and compresses images
   - Checks for duplicate complaints nearby
   - Creates complaint document in MongoDB

3. **Complaint stored with structure:**
```javascript
{
  _id: "68fd4ef1...",
  category: "Pothole",
  description: "Large pothole causing issues",
  location: {
    type: "Point",
    coordinates: [72.8777, 19.0760]
  },
  state: "Maharashtra",
  city: "Mumbai",
  status: "pending",
  photos_before: ["/uploads/image1.jpg"],
  timeline: [{
    ts: "2025-10-25T22:28:01.845Z",
    type: "submitted",
    actor: "public"
  }],
  // ... more fields
}
```

### When Authorities Take Action

Authorities can update complaints through the dashboard:

- **Start Progress**: Changes status to `in_progress`, adds timeline event
- **Add Updates**: Adds progress photos and timeline entries
- **Put on Hold**: Tracks hold periods and reasons
- **Mark Resolved**: Changes status to `resolved`, adds completion photos
- **Merge Duplicates**: Combines photos and timelines from similar complaints

### Automatic System Actions

The system automatically:

- âœ… Marks complaints as "stalled" after 60 days of no progress
- âœ… Tracks hold periods separately from stalled time
- âœ… Updates last activity timestamps
- âœ… Calculates accumulated hold duration
- âœ… Maintains complete timeline history

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints

```
GET  /api/complaints                      - List all complaints (with filters)

POST /api/complaints                      - Create new complaint
POST /api/complaints/[id]/no-progress     - Add "no progress" update
GET  /api/metrics                         - Get complaint statistics
```

### Authority Endpoints (Requires Auth)

```

## Database Query Examples

### Via Scripts

```bash
# View all complaints
npm run view-complaints

# Filter by status
npm run view-complaints status=pending

# Filter by city
npm run view-complaints city=Mumbai

# Filter by category
npm run view-complaints category=Pothole
```

### Via MongoDB Shell

```bash
# Connect
mongosh mongodb://localhost:27017/improve-my-city

# Count complaints
db.complaints.countDocuments()

# Find pending complaints
db.complaints.find({ status: "pending" })

# Find by city
db.complaints.find({ city: "Mumbai" })

# Find complaints near location (5km)
db.complaints.find({
  location: {
    $near: {
      $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [72.8777, 19.0760] },
      $maxDistance: 5000
    }
  }
})

# Get status breakdown
db.complaints.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$status", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])
```
